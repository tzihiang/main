== PROJECT: Cooking Papa

'''

== Overview

Cooking Papa is a desktop cookbook application used to manage recipes and ingredients for cooking. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 15 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: implemented and developed Cooking Papa's GUI
** What it does: developed Cooking Papa's GUI to better reflect its casual usage and more cheerful nature, rather than
the base
AB3's dark
theme.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the color scheme is more in line with
Cooking Papa's use, with the bright yet muted colors complementing the fun font styles, giving off a casual vibe, and
invites users to use Cooking Papa.
** Highlights: This enhancement required a lot of understanding of the interactions between various JavaFX objects,
as well as the base CSS stylesheets provided by AB3, and integrating them together, which took many hours of
trial-and-error,
as well
as
Googling.
+
While constraints meant that Cooking Papa would be tested from the command line, a well-designed GUI was imperative
to convey the application's casual nature.
Coordinating various colors proved to be a challenge, and the color scheme went through three rounds of reiterations,
before settling on the current one. Moving away from the rigid sharp edges of AB3 was also a challenge, and required
various UI elements and color choices to "soften" the overall aesthetics of Cooking Papa.
** Credits: _JavaFX 11_ as well as _SceneBuilder_ helped immensely in the development of the GUI.

* *Major enhancement*: integrated `cookbook view recipe` command into the GUI
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it integrated the GUI seamlessly with the
command.
** Highlights: This enhancement arose due to the lack of connection between the existing `cookbook view recipe`
command, which shows users the details of a recipe, and the GUI. It was initially displayed as a plain text result in
the result display box of the GUI, and this causes command results (errors, success messages, usage messages), to
appear in the same UI component as the recipe details, which meant that the component had two uses.
+
The idea to make `cookbook view recipe` a button on the GUI that could be toggled surfaced to improve user experience.
Developing a button that
could toggle the details shown was trivial, however, limiting the command to just a button on the GUI meant that it
would not be testable on the command line. Therefore, the challenge was to connect the GUI to the Logic component,
and typing `cookbook view recipe` on the command line (or in the command box of the GUI) would trigger the button.
The result was a GUI much more interactive and functional, but it was still testable on
the command line.
** Credits: _JavaFX 11_ as well as _SceneBuilder_ helped immensely in the development of the `cookbook view recipe`
button.

* *Minor enhancement*: added an command which allowed users to export the ingredients in their cart to a PDF file,
which allows them bring along with them to the supermarkets. This feature solved the constraint of the application
being desktop-only, and with it, Cooking Papa can _still_ help users when they are away from their computers.

* *Minor enhancement*: regularly reviewed source code, and carried out testing and bug fixing. This includes the
standardisation of coding style and messages shown to the user (
