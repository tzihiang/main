== PROJECT: Cooking Papa

---

== Overview

Cooking Papa is a desktop cookbook application used to manage recipes and ingredients for cooking.
It consists of a Cookbook containing recipes, an Inventory containing a users ingredients, and a Cart containing ingredients that a user needs to buy.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 15 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to search for recipes based on the ingredients in the inventory*
** What it does: allows the user to find recipes that match the inventory ingredients best, sorted by the similarity to the inventory ingredients.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user may not know what to cook with their ingredients, and the app should provide a convenient way to find the most suitable recipes to cook with the available ingredients.
** Highlights: This enhancement required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required a robust way of handling ingredient quantities.
** Credits: https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/[Apache Commons Math] (The `Fraction` class was used in implementing ingredient quantities)

* *Other enhancements*:
** Contributed to basic features involving ingredients, including adding and removing ingredients from recipes, and the inventory and cart
** Contributed to a feature that added the ability to add ingredients from a recipe to the cart when a user wants get ingredients for a new recipe
** Contributed to a feature that added the ability to move ingredients from the cart to the inventory after a user has finished shopping
