[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: Controls the user interface of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: Executes the commands of the App.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `cookbook remove recipe 2`.

.Component interactions for `cookbook remove recipe 2` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component https://github.com/teo-jun-xiong[(by Teo Jun Xiong)]

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of several UI parts: `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`,
`CookbookPanel`,
`RecipeCard`, `InventoryPanel`, `CartPanel`, `IngredientCard`,
`StatusBarFooter`. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component https://github.com/gohkh[(by Goh Ka Hui)]

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `CookingPapaParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a recipe).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("cookbook remove recipe 2")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `cookbook remove recipe 2` Command
image::CookbookRemoveRecipeSequenceDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component https://github.com/gohkh[(by Goh Ka Hui)]

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Cookbook data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Recipe>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Cookbook`, which `Recipe` can reference. This would allow `Cookbook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Recipe` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component https://github.com/gohkh[(by Goh Ka Hui)]

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save `Cookbook` data in json format and read it back.
* can save `Inventory` data in json format and read it back.
* can save `Cart` data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Add Recipe to the Cookbook https://github.com/teo-jun-xiong[(by Teo Jun Xiong)]
==== Implementation

The recipe addition mechanism is facilitated by `CookbookAddCommand`, which extends the `Command` abstract class. The
format of the command is as follows: `cookbook add recipe n/NAME d/DESCRIPTION [i/INGREDIENT_NAME]... [q/INGREDIENT_QUANTITY]... [t/TAG]...`.

This command is implemented this way  to allow a user to add a recipe with optional fields (ingredients, steps, tags) -
only the recipe name and recipe description are mandatory fields. This way, a user does not have input all the fields
that they may not have at the moment to create a recipe. After creating the skeleton of the recipe, the user can then
use the other `Cookbook` commands to add ingredients and steps to the recipe. However, one key point is that should
ingredient names be provided, the same number of ingredient quantities have to be provided as well.

// tag::addrecipe[]
Below is a step by step sequence of what happens when a user enters this command:

. The user enters a recipe adding command using the command line input `cookbook add recipe n/NAME d/DESCRIPTION
[i/INGREDIENT]... [q/QUANTITY]... [s/STEP_DESCRIPTION]... [t/TAG]...`.
. `CookingPapaParser` parses the user input and checks if it is valid. If it is invalid, i.e. an unknown command
category, a `ParseException` will be thrown. If the input is valid, with the command category `cookbook`, a new
`CookbookCommandParser` is created.
. `CookbookCommandParser` then parses `add recipe n/NAME d/DESCRIPTION [i/INGREDIENT]... [q/QUANTITY]...
[s/STEP_DESCRIPTION]... [t/TAG]...`. If it is invalid, i.e. an unknown command word, a `ParseException` will be
thrown. If the input is valid, with the command word `add`, a new `CookbookAddCommandParser` is created.
.  `CookbookAddCommandParser` parses `recipe n/NAME d/DESCRIPTION [i/INGREDIENT]... [q/QUANTITY]...
[s/STEP_DESCRIPTION]... [t/TAG]...` and checks if `n/NAME` and `d/DESCRIPTION` are provided. If either are not
provided, then a `ParseException` will be thrown.
+
It then
parses the input into the following fields: recipe name, recipe description, ingredients, steps, and tags.
+
Note that
the ingredient names and ingredient quantities provided must be the same, or a `ParseException` will be thrown:
+
[source,java]
----
if (names.size() != quantities.size()) {
    throw new ParseException(
        String.format(MESSAGE_DIFFERENT_NUMBER_OF_INPUTS, names.size(), quantities.size()));
}
----
{blank}

. These fields are then passed as parameters for `Recipe`, which is then passed as the parameter for
`CookbookAddCommand` and returned to `LogicManager`.
. `LogicManager` calls `CookbookAddCommand#execute()` which checks if the cookbook already contains the same recipe with the same name, description, ingredient names, ingredient quantities, and tags using `Model#hasCookbookRecipe()`.
+
If there is a duplicate, a `CommandException` is thrown, stating that the user is attempting to add a duplicate recipe:
+
[source,java]
----
if (model.hasCookbookRecipe(toAdd)) {
    throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_RECIPE);
}
----
. If `CommandException` is not thrown, `Model#addCookbookRecipe` will be executed, with the recipe to be added as a parameter.
. `Model#addCookbookRecipe()` then executes `Cookbook#addRecipe()`, which adds the recipe to the cookbook, and the
`FilteredList<Recipe>` representing the recipes in the cookbook are updated with `Model#updateFilteredCookbookRecipeList()`:
+
[source,java]
----
updateFilteredCookbookRecipeList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_RECIPES)
----
where `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_RECIPES = unused -> true`.
. A `CommandResult` with the text to display to the user is then returned to `LogicManager`, which can passed back to
`MainWindow`, which displays it to the user on the CLI and GUI: `resultDisplay.setFeedbackToUser(commandResult.getFeedbackToUser())`. The text displayed will notify the user on whether
their addition was successful.

==== Design considerations

// tag::addrecipedesign[]
===== Aspect 1: How to parse optional parameters
.Design considerations for parsing optional parameters
[cols="16%,42%,42%"]
|===
||Design A (current choice): Parse each category separately  | Design B: Parse all the categories together
|Description
|Each category (ingredient name, ingredient quantity, step description, tag) are parsed separately and returned as
`List`. If the returned `List` is empty, then it means that that field was not provided in the input, and will be set
to an empty `List` in the recipe e.g., no ingredients were provided in the command.
|Each category will be parsed together in one function in `CookbookAddCommandParser`
|Pros
a|
- Provides more flexibility for the user and does not make it mandatory to input fields that they may not necessarily
have.
- No need to deal with null values, can simply check if list is empty.
a|
- Straightforward
- No need to create and call multiple methods from other classes
|Cons
a|
- More methods have to be executed which may increase time and NPath complexity.
- Debugging and tracing becomes more confusing due to the method being defined in the lowest level of abstraction.
a|
- Have to deal with null values and include null checks (`ifPresent()` etc.)
- Method will be very long and decreases readability
|===

Design A was chosen because it was more user-friendly, and removed the restriction of having to include ingredients,
steps, and tags at the stage of recipe creation, some of which the user may not have at the moment, i.e.
experimenting with different ingredients. Additionally, design A allowed us to be more modular while coding.

.Design considerations for results to show users
===== Aspect 2: Result to show user
[cols="16%,42%,42%"]
|===
||Design A (current choice): Show a short result on the success of the command | Design B: Show all the details back to
the user
|Description|Show a message to a usage which notifies them that the command was successful in adding the recipe to
the cookbook. | Shows a message similar to design choice A, and also show all the details of the added recipe.
|Pros
a|
- Short and succinct message, tells the user what they need to know
- User interface is cleaner and more intuitive, and does not overload users with unnecessary information
a|
- Easier to implement
|Cons
a|
- Requires the graphical user interface to be able to toggle and show recipes, without the need for a command,
implemented here:

image::CookbookAddRecipe3.png[]

a|
- Overloads the user with unnecessary information
- Requires result display to take up more space than required, to reduce the need for users to scroll down the result
display.

|===

Design A was chosen because it did not reuse the same component for multiple uses. Additionally, it allows us to
reduce the size of result display, as most of the time, it displays only a short message displaying the success of a
command.

//end::addrecipedesign[]

=== View recipe in the cookbook https://github.com/teo-jun-xiong[(by Teo Jun Xiong)]
The user may use this command to view a recipe in the cookbook. This command is integrated into the Graphical User
Interface
(GUI) through a button.

==== Implementation
The recipe viewing mechanism (via the command line input) is facilitated by `CookbookViewCommand`, which extends the
`Command` abstract class. The format is as follows: `cookbook view recipe INDEX`, which index has to be a valid
integer that is not out of bounds.

The recipe viewing mechanism (via the GUI) is facilitated by `RecipeCard`, which extends the `UiPart` abstract class.
It is triggered upon clicking the "view" icon in the recipe panel:

image::CookbookAddRecipe3.png[width="500"]

Implementing this function, `cookbook view recipe` through a button in the GUI allows user to view the details of a
recipe with a click of a button, greatly increasing convenience and user experience. The button also had to be
"activated" without the
button,
as
the command still had
to be testable through the command line.

//tag::viewrecipe[]
Below is a step by step sequence of what happens when a user enters this command:

. The user enters a view recipe command using the command line input `cookbook view recipe INDEX`.
. `CookingPapaParser` parses the user input and checks if it is valid. If it is invalid, i.e. an unknown command
category, a `ParseException` will be thrown. If the input is valid, with the command category `cookbook`, a new
`CookbookCommandParser` is created.
. `CookbookCommandParser` then parses `view recipe INDEX`. If it is invalid, i.e. an unknown command word, a
                                       `ParseException` will be
thrown. If the input is valid, with the command category `view`, a new `CookbookViewCommandParser` is created.
. `CookbookViewCommandParser` then parses `recipe INDEX` and checks if the `String` contains "recipe", and an index.
If either are absent, a `ParseException` will be thrown. If the `String` is valid, a `CookbookView` is created.
. `CookbookViewCommandParser` then returns a `CookbookViewCommand` to `LogicManager`.
. `LogicManager` calls `CookbookViewCommand#execute()` which checks if the provided `Index` is within the bounds of
the `FilteredCookbookRecipeList()` in `Cookbook`, i.e. `index.getZeroBased() >= list.size()`. If it is not, a
`CommandException` will be thrown. If it is valid, a `CommandResult` is created with a boolean value `true`.
. A `CommandResult` with the text to display to the user will be returned to `LogicManager`. The `CommandResult` is
then passed back to `MainWindow`. The boolean value stated in step 6 determines whether a successfully parsed command
is a `cookbook view recipe INDEX` command.
. `MainWindow#handleViewRecipe` is then executed, which creates a new `CookbookPanel` with the same set of data,
calling `CookbookPanel#handleViewRecipe`, which creates new `RecipeCard` s for `Cookbook`, and for the `RecipeCard`
that has an index equal to the index processed from the user's input, it will create a `RecipeCard` that toggles open
the recipe details. More on how the `RecipeCard` manages this will be discussed in the following section on how
clicking on a button in the GUI has the same effect as the `cookbook view recipe INDEX` command.
. Lastly, the user then is shown a `CookbookPanel` with the selected recipe toggled open, which displays the full
details
of that recipe:
+
image::CookbookViewExample2.png[]

Below is a step by step sequence of what happens when a user clicks the button on the GUI:

. When the button is pressed, the onAction method, `RecipeCard#handleViewButtonAction()` is executed. A `RecipeCard`
has a variable `isFullyDisplayed`, which indicates whether it is displaying an overview of the recipe, or
fully displaying details of the recipe.
. If `isFullyDisplayed` is false, i.e. the `RecipeCard` is currently displaying an overview of the recipe,
`RecipeCard#displayRecipeComplete()` is executed, which replaces the text displayed by the FXML object, `Label`, with
the full details of the recipe.
. If `isFullyDisplayed` is true, i.e. the `RecipeCard` is currently fully displaying the details of the recipe,
`RecipeCard#displayRecipeOverview()` is executed, which replaces the text displayed by the FXML object, `Label` with
the overview of the recipe.
. Both methods executed in step 3 and 4 will flip the boolean value of `isFullyDisplayed`, and this means that the
next time the button for the same recipe is clicked, it toggles back. For example, if a recipe with its overview
shown has its view button clicked, it will show the full details of the recipe. If the button is clicked again, it
toggles, and shows the overview of the recipe.
+
This feature is not reflected with `cookbook view recipe INDEX` when it is entered again in the command line, because
the function of the command is to view a recipe, not to "un-view" it.
//end::viewrecipe[]

//tag::viewrecipesequence[]
The following sequence diagram shows how the recipe viewing function interacts between the classes in `Logic`:

//end::viewrecipesequence[]

==== Design considerations
Aspect: what UI component to display the toggled content

.Design considerations for the UI component to display the toggled content

[cols="16%,42%,42%"]
|===
||Design A (current choice): toggles the content in the recipe panel|Design B: add a new UI component that pops up, i
.e. overlay
|Description|The content in the recipe panel can freely switch from overview to full details of a recipe.|A UI
component appears as a small overlay, displaying the details of a recipe. The overlay can then be "exited" by clicking
on
an area within the application that is outside of the overlay.
|Pros
a|
- Intuitive that clicking the button once more should return to the previous state
- Increases functionality of the GUI, rather than just a "skin"
| No need to interact between various UI components, as much as design A
|Cons|There is a need to keep track of the state of a `RecipeCard`, which means more constructors and conditional
statements to implement.
|Difficult to implement as it includes creating an entirely new component (overlay) with different features than the
existing one. The effort estimated did not seem to be worth, as the use is limited to just this command.
|===

Design A was chosen because it made the GUI more functional, and less complicated to implement in terms of connecting
the various `UiPart` s.

// tag::gohkh[]
=== Search for recipes based on ingredients in the inventory https://github.com/gohkh[(by Goh Ka Hui)]
The user may use this command to search for recipes that they can cook using the ingredients available in their
inventory.

==== Implementation reasoning
This command was implemented to address the users' need of easily finding a recipe based on the ingredients they have
. It
allows users to whip up a meal without having to go grocery shopping if they are short of time. This feature sorts
recipes by how much the inventory fulfils their ingredient requirements, and filters out recipes whose ingredient
requirements are not met at all. Users can immediately see at the top of the cookbook the recipes that their ingredients
are most suitable for preparing. A user can use this feature by typing the command: `cookbook search inventory`.

==== Implementation
The comparison between the ingredients a recipe requires and the ingredients in the inventory is facilitated by the
`RecipeInventoryIngredientsSimilarityComparator`. It extends `Comparator<Recipe>` and stores the inventory being used
for ingredient comparison. Additionally, it implements the method `calculateSimilarity()`, which accepts a `Recipe` and
a `ReadOnlyInventory` as parameters, and returns a double value between 0 and 1 (both inclusive) that represents the
proportion of the recipe's ingredient requirements that are fulfilled.

The following class diagram summarizes how the `RecipeInventoryIngredientsSimilarityComparator` interacts with `Recipe`
and `Inventory`:

.Class diagram for RecipeInventoryIngredientsSimilarityComparator
image::CookbookSearchByInventoryClassDiagram.png[]

The `calculateSimilarity()` method first calculates the proportion of ingredient quantity fulfilled by the inventory
for each ingredient that the recipe requires. For example, if one of the ingredients required by a recipe is `4 eggs`
and the inventory contains `2 eggs`, the proportion fulfilled for this particular ingredient is `0.5`. This is done for
all the ingredients in the recipe. If the units of an ingredient in the recipe does not match that of the same
ingredient in the inventory, the proportion will be set at `0.5` by default. An example is when the recipe requires
`1 cup flour` and the inventory contains `200 g flour`.

When the proportion fulfilled has been calculated for each ingredient, the values for each ingredient are summed up and
divided by the number of ingredients to obtain the average. In the case where the recipe does not have any ingredients
added to it yet, the `calculateSimilarity()` method will return `0`, indicating no similarity to the inventory
ingredients. This is because it is likely that recipes with no ingredients have just been added by the user, and the
ingredients have not been added yet. If the user is using this feature to search for a recipe to cook, they would
probably not be interested in seeing a recipe that they have not added ingredients for yet. This is implemented via
a guard clause as shown in the following code snippet:

[source,java]
----
if (recipe.getIngredients().size() == NO_INGREDIENTS) {
    return ZERO_SIMILARITY;
}
----

The following activity diagram shows a possible flow of events for a user using this feature:

with more focus on how the command is parsed in the `Logic`component:

==== Design considerations
===== Aspect 1: Weighting of each ingredient

.Design considerations for weighing of each ingredient
[cols="12%,44%,44%"]
|===
| |Design A (Current choice): Every ingredient is weighted equally | Design B: More important ingredients are given a larger weigting

| Description
| The similarity of a recipe's ingredients to an inventory's ingredients is calculated by taking the mean of the proportions calculated for each ingredient,
with equal weighting given to all ingredients.
|The similarity of a recipe's ingredients to an inventory's ingredients is calculated by taking the weighted mean of the proportions calculated for each ingredient,
with larger weightings given to more important ingredients ingredients.

| Pros
| Gives a good rough estimate of the proportion of ingredient requirements fulfilled for a recipe, and straightforward to implement.
| May give a better gauge of the proportion of ingredient requirements fulfilled for a recipe, by accounting for the importance of the ingredient.
For example, beef would be an important ingredient for a steak recipe, but garnishes might be considered less important as they can be substituted more easily.

| Cons
| Does not account for the importance of the ingredient in the recipe
| Difficult to judge the importance of the ingredient, and complicated to implement categorisation of the types ingredients and their relative importance.
|===

Design A was chosen as it provided a fair estimate of the similarity between the recipe and inventory ingredients, with a simple implementation.
The cons for Design B were deemed to outweigh the pros, especially since the importance of an ingredient in a recipe could be rather subjective.

===== Aspect 2: Handling ingredients with different units

.Design consideration for handling ingredients with different units
[cols="12%,44%,44%"]
|===
| |Design A (Current choice): Use a default similarity value of `0.5` | Design B: Convert the units

| Description
| The similarity value of an ingredient with different units in the recipe and the inventory is treated as `0.5`.
| The similarity value of an ingredient with different units in the recipe and the inventory is calculated by converting the units,
such that the proportion of the recipe ingredient in the inventory can be determined.

| Pros
| Simple to implement.
| Able to calculate the proportion of the recipe ingredient fulfilled by the inventory, even when dealing with different units.

| Cons
| Unable to calculate the proportion of the recipe ingredient fulfilled by the inventory when dealing with different units, and can only give a fixed default value of `0.5`.
| More complicated to implement as it requires CookingPapa to recognise the units in both the recipe and inventory and be able to convert between them.
Some units such as `cup` may also not have a standard conversion factor.
|===

Design A was chosen due to time constraints, as handling the conversion between different units would take time away from developing other parts of the application.
Given more time, Design B will be implemented to handle conversion for standard units, such as between `g` and `kg`, but Design A would still have to be used for units with non-standard conversion factors.
// end::gohkh[]

=== Adding ingredients to inventory and cart https://github.com/tzihiang[(by Tay Zi Hiang Willis)]

The inventory and cart acts as storage for `Ingredient` classes. They are facilitated by `InventoryCommand` and `CartCommand`
respectively, which extends the `Command` abstract class. Since `CartAddCommand` and `InventoryAddCommand` both serve the
same purpose in different contexts of `Cart` and `Inventory` respectively, they will be mentioned together in tandem. +

This command was implemented to allow the user know to add an ingredient to the cart or inventory respectively.
An ingredient only has two main components - its name and quantity. We allow the user to use their own measurement up to their own
preferences and do not force any fixed unit of measurement. Although similar, `Cart` and `Ingredients` differ in certain functions
from a user's point of view. For a user to immediately sort where they wish to sort the ingredient they are adding, `Cart` and


==== Implementation

Below is a step-by-step sequence of what happens when the command `cart add ingredient i/INGREDIENT_NAME q/INGREDIENT_QUANTITY` is added.

. The user adds a ingredient to the cart by entering the command `cart  add ingredient i/INGREDIENT_NAME q/INGREDIENT_QUANTITY` in the command line input.
. `CartAddCommandParser` parsers the input to check and verify that the input provided for `i/INGREDIENT_NAME` amd `q/INGREDIENT_QUANTITY`
are correct. Otherwise a `ParseException` will be thrown.
. The fields are then passed to `CartAddIngredientCommand` as an `Ingredient` object and is returned to `LogicManager`.
. `LogicManager` calls `CartAddIngredientCommand#execute()` and checks if the `Ingredient` object given has the same `INGREDIENT_NAME` and
`INGREDIENT_QUANTITY` unit. If that `Ingredient` exists, it will simply add on to the quantity of that ingredient. Otherwise,
a new instance of that `Ingredient` will be added to the Cart.
. If `CommandException` is not thrown, `Model#addCartIngredient` will be executed, with the given `Ingredient` as the parameter
. `Model#addCartIngredient` then executes, adding the `Ingredient` to the local cart storage and updates with
`Model#updateFilteredCartIngredientList()`.
. A `CommandResult` with the successful text message is returned to `LogicManager` and will be displayed to the user via the GUI to feedback to the
user that the `Ingredient` has been successfully added.

The above implementation is the same for `Inventory` with the command `inventory  add ingredient i/INGREDIENT_NAME q/INGREDIENT_QUANTITY`

| |Design A (Current choice): Create parsers for every individual action | Design B: Create parsers for each specific action

|Description
|The command will go through the parsers in the following order: `CookingPapaParser` -> `CartCommandParser` -> `CartAddCommandParser`
-> `CartAddIngredientParser` before finally returning `CartAddIngredientCommand`. We eventually went with this as we wanted the add
functionality to be expanded, namely to be able to add all the ingredients of cookbook recipes into the cart.

|Pros
|More organised and can do more with `cart add` as the prefix.
|The classes can be more specific and atomic in their actions.

|Cons
|Many parser classes to make and keep track of.
|Might lead to disorganisation during troubleshooting with so many classes to keep track.

=== Remove ingredients of a recipe from the inventory https://github.com/shanecsj[(by Chan Shun Jie)]

==== Implementation
The mechanism is facilitated by `InventoryCookCommand`, which extends the `Command` abstract class. The format of the command is as follows: `inventory cook recipe INDEX`.

This command was implemented to allow users to remove multiple ingredients and their quantities found in a recipe from their inventory.
If the inventory contains an ingredient that has a higher quantity than specified in the selected recipe, its quantity will be subtracted accordingly.
If the ingredient has a lower quantity than specified in the selected recipe or if there is a missing ingredient in the inventory, the feature will not be executed and an error will be thrown.
Without this command, users can only remove ingredients through the `inventory remove ingredient` command one at a time.
Moreover, they have to constantly cross-check the ingredient quantities in the recipe for accuracy.
Therefore, this command provides convenience after users have prepared a recipe and wish to update their inventory ingredients through a single step.

Below is a step-by-step sequence of what happens when a user enters this command:

. The user enters an inventory cook command `inventory cook recipe INDEX` using the command line input.
. `InventoryCookCommandParser` parses the input to check and verify the input provided by the user. If the input provided is invalid, a `ParseException` will be thrown.
. The valid index is then passed to `InventoryCookCommand` as an `Index` object.
. `LogicManager` calls `InventoryCookCommand#execute()` and checks if the `Index` provided is within bounds and if the specified `Recipe` contains ingredients.
Otherwise, a `CommandException` is thrown.
. Subsequently, two checks are performed to check if the inventory contains all of the ingredients specified and whether those quantities are sufficient to be subtracted.
. If all the checks passed, `model#removeInventoryIngredient` is called through a `stream()` to remove the ingredients of a selected recipe from the inventory.
+
[source,java]
----
selectedRecipe.getIngredients().stream().forEach(model::removeInventoryIngredient);
----
. A `CommandResult` with a success message is returned to `LogicManager` and passed back to `MainWindow` which displays the text to the user through the GUI.

The following sequence diagram shows how the command `inventory cook recipe 1` works:

.Design considerations for the `inventory cook recipe` command
[cols="12%,44%,44%"]
|===
||Design A: Allow the execution of `inventory cook recipe` command regardless of missing or insufficient ingredients in the inventory  | Design B (Current choice): Do not allow execution of `inventory cook recipe` command when there are missing or insufficient ingredients in the inventory

|Description
|Allow the users to execute the command regardless of missing or insufficient ingredients in the inventory. Missing ingredients will be ignored and ingredients with insufficient quantities will be entirely removed.
|When there are missing or insufficient ingredients in the inventory, the execution of the command will throw an error to warn users whether they have missing ingredients or insufficient ingredients in their inventory.

|Pros
|Straightforward for users to use the command as they do not have to check whether they have all the ingredients in sufficient quantities.
|Enhances user experience. The application can notify users that they have missing or insufficient ingredients when they attempt to prepare a recipe through this command.

|Cons
|Reduces code readability as more methods and steps are needed to check and isolate a list of missing and insufficient ingredients. This list of ingredients are also to be treated differently from the other ingredients when removing from the inventory.
|A potential hassle for users as they have to ensure that all ingredients are present and are sufficient in their inventory to use the command.

=== Moving ingredients from cart to inventory https://github.com/tzihiang[(by Tay Zi Hiang Willis)]
The user may use this command after their shopping trip. With this one command, all ingredients will be shifted from the cart to the inventory.

This command is implemented to ease the process of having the user adding every single ingredient to their inventory after they have bought ingredients from their cart
and eventually deleting the cart after that tedious process. These gives a convenience to users that frequently use our application and we forsee
that such an action will be used very often by these users. As this command only performs an atomic action, no extra
arguments are needed to further supplement the use of this command.

==== Implementation
This command is facilitated by `CartMoveCommand`, which extends the `Command` class. The format of the command is as follows:
`cart move`.

Below is a step by step sequence of what happens when the user executes this command.

. The user enters the command `cart move` in to the command line input.
. `CartMoveCommandParser` then ensures that the user does not enter any other commands after `cart clear`.
. `CartMoveCommandParser` then returns a `CartMoveCommand` and returns it to `LogicManager`
. `LogicManager` calls `CartMoveCommand#execute()`. If there are other commands after `cart clear`, a `CommandException`
will be thrown.
. If `CommandException` is not thrown, `Model#cartMoveIngredients()` will be executed.
. `Model#cartMoveIngredients()` will move every ingredient from the `cart` and add it into the `inventory`
. A `CommandResult` with the success message text will be returned to `LogicManager`, which will then be passed to `MainWindow`
and will then feedback to the user.


The following sequence diagram shows how this function works (full command omitted for brevity):

[cols="16%,42%,42%"]
|===
| |Design A (Current choice): Move all ingredients | Design B: Allow users to move individually or exclude some ingredients when moving

|Description
|There was a consideration to allow the user to move the ingredients by individual ingredients. Eventually the options was
not given as we know that typical users will want to move all the ingredients except for individual ingredients.
| The use cases of such an action happening is very little and the user can simply manually remove the few
ingredients they do not wish to add to the inventory after using the `cart move` command. The user can also manually
add back the ingredients to the cart after it is cleared if they wish to.

|Pros
|Straightforward to implement
|Lesser implementations, more time to focus on other parts of the project

|Cons
|Lesser functionality to users that really want to only move certain ingredients
|Poorer user experience for users that do not want to move all ingredients from the cart to inventory on a regular basis,

=== Add a Recipe's Ingredients to Cart https://github.com/hans555[(by Ong Han Sheng)]

The user may want to buy the required ingredients to cook a certain recipe in the cookbook. This feature allows the user
to add a certain recipe's required ingredients into the cart.

==== Implementation

The action of adding a recipe's ingredients to cart mechanism is facilitated by `CartAddRecipeIngredientCommand`, which
extends the `CartAddCommand` abstract class. The format is as follows: `cart add recipe INDEX`.

This command is implemented to ease the tedious process of having the user adding every single ingredient
to their cart when they want to purchase ingredients to cook a certain recipe. This provides convenience to users
that frequently use our application and such process like shopping for a certain recipe's ingredient is
intuitive to users. Furthermore, this command creates interaction between the `Cookbook` and `Cart` which
helps to further integrate the application as an all-in-one application.

Below is a step by step sequence of what happens when a user enters this command:

. The user enters the command `cart add recipe INDEX`  in the command line  input.
. `CartAddRecipeIngredientParser` parses the user input and checks if the index provided is an integer.
Note that the parser will throw a `ParseException` if the given index is not an integer.
[source,java]
try {
    recipeIndex = ParserUtil.parseIndex(argMultimap.getPreamble());
} catch (ParseException pe) {
    throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_RECIPE_DISPLAYED_INDEX, CartAddCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE), pe);
}

. The index is passed as a parameter for `CartAddRecipeIngredientCommand` which is returned to `LogicManager`.
. `LogicManager` calls `CartAddRecipeIngredientCommand#execute()` which checks if the given index is
a valid index of a recipe. Note that the command will throw a `CommandException` if the given index is not valid.
[source, java]
if (recipeIndex.getZeroBased() >= model.getCookbook().getRecipeList().size()) {
    throw new CommandException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_RECIPE_DISPLAYED_INDEX, MESSAGE_USAGE));
}

. If the index is valid, the selected recipe's ingredients will be added accordingly. This is done through calling
`Model#addCartIngredient()`, with each ingredient as the parameter.
. `Model#addCartIngredient` calls `Cart#addIngredident()` which then adds the ingredient to the cart.
If a certain ingredient exists in the cart, adding a ingredient to a cart will increase the
quantity instead. Otherwise, a new instance of that ingredient will be added to the cart.
After adding an ingredient, the cart will be updated with `Model#updateFilteredCartIngredientList()`.
. A `CommandResult` with the successful text message is returned to `LogicManager`
and will be displayed to the user via the GUI to feedback to the user that
the selected recipe's ingredients has been successfully added to the cart.

==== Design considerations
===== Aspect: Allowing users to add all or some recipe's ingredients
.Design considerations for allowing users to add only recipe's ingredients that are not present in the inventory to the cart
[cols="12%,44%,44%"]
|===
||Design A (current choice): Adding all recipe's ingredients to the cart|Design B: Adding only recipe's ingredients
that are missing in the inventory to the cart
|Description
| Allows user to add a recipe's ingredients to the cart for shopping. This design is currently chosen due to ease of
implementation and it works for all situations.
| Allows user to add a recipe's ingredients base on the inventory status. However, there are some situations where
this design not does work. One example would be like planning to cook at outside where the inventory status is unknown.
|Pros
a|
- Easier to implement as it does not need to check if the ingredients are already present in the inventory
- Works for all situations as it ensures that the user is able to cook this recipe after buying the ingredients in the cart
a|
- Provide a more intuitive experience of the application as user only need to buy ingredients that are missing in the inventory
|Cons
a|
- Less flexible as users have to manually remove some of the recipe's ingredients that they do not want to buy
a|
- Harder to implement as additional checking is required to filter a recipe's ingredients that are missing in the inventory
- Users have to manually add some of the recipe's ingredients that they want to buy although it is present in the inventory

=== Export ingredients in cart to PDF file https://github.com/teo-jun-xiong[(by Teo Jun Xiong)]
The user may use this command to export the ingredients in their cart to a <<PDF, PDF>> file, which they can then
use as their shopping list at the supermarkets.

==== Implementation
The cart exporting mechanism is facilitated by `CookbookExportCommand`, which extends the `Command` abstract class.
The format is as follows: `cart export`.

This command was implemented to bridge the (current, v1.4) inadequacy of Cooking Papa, which is that it is not
portable (yet). It was still not convenient _enough_ to be able to organize cart ingredients. Evenutally, users had
to go outside to the supermarket, and Cooking Papa is a desktop-only application. By allowing users to export the
ingredients in their cart to a PDF file, they can then print it out, or transfer it to their mobile devices, and
bring them along as shopping lists. Additionally, the layout and content of the generated PDF file is simple,
informational, and easy for users to extend, allowing them to add (handwritten or  annotated) remarks.

// tag::cartexport[]
Below is a step by step sequence of what happens when a user enters this command:

. The user enters a cart export command using the command line input `cart export`.
. `CookingPapaParser` parses the user input and checks if it is valid. If it is invalid, i.e. an unknown command
category, a `ParseException` will be thrown. If the input is valid, with the command category `cart`, a new
`CartCommandParser` is created.
. `CartCommandParser` then parses `export`. If it is invalid, i.e. an unknown command word, a `ParseException` will be
thrown. If the input is valid, with the command category `export`, a new `CookbookExportCommandParser` is created.
. `CartExportCommandParser` parses the user input and checks if the argument passed to it is an empty String, as the
command takes in no extra parameters.
+
Note that if the String is not empty, a `ParseException` will be thrown:
+
[source,java]
----
if (userInput.isEmpty()) {
    return new CartExportCommand();
} else {
    throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, CartExportCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
}
----
+
This means that `cart export ingredient` will not work.
. `CartExportCommandParser` then returns a `CartExportCommand` to `LogicManager`.
. `LogicManager` calls `CartExportCommand#execute()` calls the static method of `PdfExporter`,
`PdfExporter#exportCart()`, which takes in the `ObservableList<Ingredient>` stored in `Cart`
. Step 4 is executed within a try-catch block. If a previously generated pdf (saved as `cart.pdf` by default) is
opened in another program, or there is an issue writing to the PDF file, a `CommandResult` with an error
message will returned to `LogicManager` (skipping step 7 and 8):
+
[source,java]
----
try {
    PdfExporter.exportCart(model.getCart().getIngredientList());
} catch (IOException e) {
    return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_FILE_NOT_FOUND);
}
----
. The ingredients in the `Cart` is passed to the static method `PdfExporter#exportCart()`, which then makes use of
the library, `PDFbox`, to parse the data.
. Within `PdfExporter`, `PdfExporter#getTextFromCart` parse the data and splits them manually, in order to wrap the
text (this has to be done due to the inadequacy of `PDFbox`). The method returns a `List<String>`, where each string
represents a new line on the PDF file.
. Subsequently, `PdfExporter` checks if the number of `String` s in the list in step 7 is greater than the number of
lines a single page of the PDF can accomodate. If it is, it adds a new page, and adds lines to the PDF until the
limit is hit. This repeats until all the lines are added to the PDF.
. A `CommandResult` with the text to display to the user will be returned to `LogicManager`. The
`CommandResult` is then passed back to `MainWindow`, which displays it to the user on the CLI and GUI: `resultDisplay
.setFeedbackToUser(commandResult.getFeedbackToUser())`. The text displayed will notify the user on whether
their addition was successful.

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on, and are in no way exhaustive.

Below are some test inputs for manual testing, please note that these test inputs are *only* valid for the sample
cookbook, cart, and inventory data, i.e. the data that is present when Cooking Papa is opened for the first time. If
the data has been modified prior to using these commands, please delete the `.json` files in `/data` (`cookbook
                                                                                                       .json`, `inventory.json`, `cart.json`).

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Double-click the jar file +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample cookbook, inventory, and cart.

=== Adding a recipe to the cookbook

Please note that these cases are to be tested individually, i.e. should test case
a be executed, executing test case e will not be valid as there is already an existing recipe with the recipe name
"Name". In such cases, please remove the existing recipe in the cookbook using `cookbook remove recipe INDEX`.

.. Prerequisites: List all recipes in the cookbook using the `cookbook list` command, and *using the sample cookbook*.
.. Test case: `cookbook add recipe n/Name d/Description i/Ingredient q/1 s/Step 1 t/Tag` +
   Expected: a new recipe is added to the cookbook, and displayed as the index 3 (one-based index) in the cookbook
panel.
.. Test case: `cookbook add recipe n/Name d/Description i/Ingredient q/1 s/Step 1 t/Tag` (a duplicate recipe) +
   Expected: no recipe will be added, and an error message indicating that there is already an existing recipe with
the same name in the cookbook will
be displayed.
.. Test case: `cookbook add recipe n/Name d/Description i/Ingredient q/1 s/Step 1 s/Step 1 t/Tag` (a recipe with
duplicated
steps) +
   Expected: no recipe will be added, and an error message indicating that there is a duplicate step  in the command
will
be displayed.
.. Test case: `cookbook add recipe n/Name d/Description i/Ingredient q/1 i/Ingredient q/1 s/Step 1t/Tag` (a recipe with
duplicated
ingredients) +
   Expected: a new recipe is added to the cookbook, with the duplicate ingredients being added to one another. The
new recipe will be displayed as the index 3 (one-based index) in the cookbook panel.

=== Removing a recipe from the cookbook
Please note that these test cases are to be tested individually, i.e. should test case a be executed, executing test
case a again will remove a different recipe from the cookbook. In this case, after executing test case a once, to
execute it again, please add back the removed recipe using `cookbook add recipe ...` or by deleting the `.json` files.

.. Prerequisites: List all recipes in the cookbook using the `cookbook list` command, and *using the sample
cookbook*.
.. Test case: `cookbook remove recipe 1` +
    Expected: a recipe (Aglio Olio) will be removed from the cookbook.
.. Test case: `cookbook remove recipe 0` and `cookbook remove recipe 5` +
    Expected: since the indices in the recipe panel are one-based, i.e. starting from 1, the former command is
out-of-bounds; the latter command is out-of-bounds because there are only 4 recipes in the cookbook. Both commands
will show an error message reflecting the invalid recipe indices provided.

=== Searching for recipes by tags
Please note for this search command, with more tags being included, the number of results returned will be greater, i
.e. if
there are three tags included, the recipes returned do not have to be tagged with all three tags.

.. Prerequisites: List all recipes in the cookbook using the `cookbook list` command, and *using the sample cookbook*.
.. Test case: `cookbook search tag t/Simple` +
    Expected: the recipe panel will be updated to show only two recipes, both which are tagged with "Simple".
.. Test case: `cookbook search tag t/Simple t/Celebrity`
    Expected: the recipe panel will be updated to show only three recipes, of these three recipes, they are either
tagged with "Simple" or "Celebrity".

=== Adding an ingredient to a recipe

Please note that the results of these test cases are based on the sample cookbook.

.. Prerequisites: List all recipes in the cookbook with the `cookbook list` command, and view all the ingredients in recipe 1 with the `cookbook view recipe INDEX` command, *using the sample cookbook*.
.. Test case: `recipe 1 add ingredient i/Olive Oil q/1 tbsp` +
   Expected: 1 tbsp of olive oil is added to the recipe, and the ingredient quantity of olive oil is changed from 1 to 2 tbsp.
.. Test case: `recipe 1 add ingredient i/Olive Oil q/1 tsp` (an ingredient with incompatible units) +
   Expected: the specified ingredient will not be added, and an error message indicating that the existing ingredient in the recipe has a different unit will be displayed.
.. Test case: `recipe 1 add ingredient i/Ingredient q/1` (a new ingredient) +
   Expected: the specified ingredient is added to the recipe.

=== Exporting the cart to a PDF file
Please note that for the export command, the result is based on the sample cart.
a. Prerequisite: have the sample cart data in `cart.json`, if the file has been modified, please exit Cooking Papa,
and delete it in `/data`, and run Cooking Papa again.

.. Test case: `cart export`
    Expected: a PDF file will be created in the same folder as Cooking Papa, and the content should look like:
+
.Content of cart.pdf created from sample cart data
image::CookbookExportExample2.png[]

.. Test case: `cart export`, with a previously created `cart.pdf` open in a program
    Expected: an error will be thrown, as `PdfExporter` is unable to modify a file that is currently open in another
program. Closing the file and executing the command will return the same result (assuming the cart data is the same
as the sample cart data)
as test case a.

|Achievements/ challenges|Effort required|Difficulty level (out of `\***` )
|Greater number of entities than AB3|As AB3 only had one overarching entity (`Person`), it was a challenge to extract
the implementation for `Person` and apply it to three overarching entities (`Cart`, `Cookbook`, `Inventory`). Much
time was spent refactoring to our needs, but was not too tough given the great documentation and clarity in AB3's
code.|`**`
|Development of the GUI | As the team had not much experience with regards to CSS and JavaFX, it took awhile to get
rolling and adapt the aesthetics to Cooking Papa's needs. Moreover, one challenge faced was ensuring that the GUI ran
as expected on Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

Additionally, the use of SceneBuilder was encouraged, however, it led to many unintended changes and extra variables
which made troubleshooting a lot more complex (especially to a novice).

|Integrating `cookbook view command` with a button on the GUI|We wanted to make the command more of a toggle instead
of something users *had* to type, as it was not intuitive. While implementing the button was rather trivial, one
requirement of the app was that it had to be testable via the command line. Connecting the command from the command
line (`Logic`) to the `UI` was a big challenge, especially while trying to maintain the abstraction between the
two.

In hindsight, perhaps greater experience with GUIs would have made this process easier, but our team were
all novices in that aspect, and being able to pull this off, especially when we could have simply left it as the
status quo, is a huge achievement.|`\***`
|Refactoring `cart export` code|As the original PDF library used (iTextPDF) has not permitted due to its license, the
whole code had to be refactored to use the current PDF library (Apache PDFbox). The challenge was the lack of
features in PDFbox, i.e. tables were not a feature, and had to be drawn using lines. This was a huge hinder in
achieving the intended output PDF file. Eventually, it was decided to simply create a list in the PDF instead of a
table due to the lack of time, and the payoff for tinkering with PDFbox was not worth the effort.|`**`
